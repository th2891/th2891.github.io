### MPH candidate at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health 

I am a second year MPH candidate in the Department of Epidemiology at Mailman School of Public Health, pursuing a certificate in Epidemiology of Chronic disease. Much of my coursework has been focused on theory and methods of epidemiological research.

After graduation, I hope to pursue a career where I can apply my epidemiological and data analysis skills to further improve access to preventative care for chronic diseases.
